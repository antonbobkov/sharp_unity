# sharp_unity

SharpUnity is a simple online multiplayer game where players run around in segmented procedurally generated 2D world.
They can place and collect blocks.
Each world segment is assigned a different server (verifier).
Moving between segments transitions the player from one server to the other.

C#.NET, Unity3D, TCP/IP

Below are some screenshots from the server and from the clients (note the overlap between the client screens).
